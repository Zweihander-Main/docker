# Android Connectivity Check

> Simple server that returns a 204, for use with the WiFi connectivity check for Android

If you're running a stripped down form of Android (ex Lineage), you may be disappointed to find that your device still 'phones home' to Google whenever it joins a WiFi network. It specifically looks for a `204` response code from `https://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204`. This docker image generates a similar response and can be set as the connectivity check URL:

```
settings put global captive_portal_http_url "http://yoursite.com/"
settings put global captive_portal_https_url "https://yoursite.com/"
```

## Instructions

```
docker run -d --name=android-connectivity-check --publish=80:8080 zweizs/android-connectivity-check
```

Combine with Traefik or reverse proxy of your choice for best results.
